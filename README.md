### Using Balance

#### The Landing page

The Landing Page, or the initial webpage, that loads when a user goes to the deployment address is a One-Page Picth encouraging users to either Sign Up or Sign In.
The Landing Page has a simple navigation bar with three options: a logo, Sign Up, or Sign In.
The body of the landing page body has a full size hero image background. Sales pitch to the left, and a sign up container on the right. 

The sign Up container also has an option to sign in. Registered users are able to click the sign-in from the navbar or from container. The sign up and sales pitch container is replaced with a single login container dynamically. The Sign In container has the option to return to the Sign Up Container. 
If a user clicks on the Sign Up Button from the NavBar or from the the Sign-In container, the sign-in container is replaced with a single Sign Up container.

#### After Logging In

The first page users see after logging in is the Dashboard.

Below is a "Business at a Glance" Chart section that displays a graph showing Year to Date Information on Sales vs Expenses vs. Profit. This chart is full page width.
Next is two other widgets. The widget on the left shows Unpaid and/or Overdue Expense Invoices. The container on the right lists the last 7 days Gross Sales. Days with no information shows as an error.
At the bottom of the page is a footer with with copyright and privacy information.
